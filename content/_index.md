## <span class="accent-text">$</span> whoami

I do cool things (Linux, ARM, AppDev, Blender, Crypto*) sometimes, and normal things (sleeping, eating, playing games) other times. I will be attending <span title="go bears">UC Berkeley</span> starting Fall 2020, and am a little sad that I can't go and meet everyone [in person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic). :(
