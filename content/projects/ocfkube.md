### OCF Kubernetes Cluster

[Git](https://github.com/ocf/kubernetes) | [Post](#wip)

[~fydai](https://fyd.ai) and I are upgrading the Puppet / Debian / VM based infrastructure at the [Berkeley Open Computing Facility](https://ocf.berkeley.edu/) to [Kubernetes](https://k8s.io)! After evaluating hundreds of "cloud-native" technologies, we finally settled on a tech stack that has been simple and low-maintainance. A cluster operator keeps track of how the representation in Git is different from the real cluster, and periodically converges the two.

I can help your company do this too: [contact me](/card).
