[Someone](https://github.com/Torbuntu) *really* wanted to run Fedora on their PinePhone. I also use Fedora, so I began laying the groundwork to get Fedora to run on the PinePhone. Currently, calls, mobile data, and texts all work, so it's usable if you can look past the bugs. I'm currently working with [Peter Robinson](https://nullr0ute.com/) and [Torbuntu](https://github.com/Torbuntu) to get everything officially into Fedora. If you'd like to help out, see the Wiki link above for contribution information.
