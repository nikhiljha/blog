See the <a href="https://ethyl.io/">website</a> for more information. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a massive developing category with a lot of potential applications. Unfortunately, many IoT implementations today rely on a centralized server to stay operational. This is bad because when the company that makes the device goes bankrupt, or [just decides they want to end service for you](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sonos-abandoning-its-legacy-customers-is-precisely-what-is-wrong-with-iot/), you're out of luck. Ethyl combines the two, taking advantage of HomeAssistant to provide stable, permanent support for many IoT devices.
