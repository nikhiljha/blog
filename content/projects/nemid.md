Decentralized websites and applications shouldnâ€™t have to rely on usernames and passwords. People forget them and reuse easy to guess passwords across sites, making them insecure. A password manager alleviates some of these problems, but it's difficult to convince people to use them.

Meet NEMid, a password-free way to sign in. Using public key cryptography, NEMid can sign you into compatible websites and apps with just a button press. No pesky usernames or passwords required!
