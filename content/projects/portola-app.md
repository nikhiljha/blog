My high school doesn't have bells! As a result, people end up scrambling to class much later than they probably should. Making things worse, every day has a different schedule. We can never quite remember what time class starts.

Meet Portola App! (very inspired name, I know) It tells you how much time you have until your next class starts, as well as when Lunch or Break ends! There are also some convenience features, such as a Virtual ID Card (to check out books from the library), a built in copy of the school newspaper, sports scores, and more! The goal is to make life on campus as easy as possible for everyone, and to create a "maker/hacker" type community at my high school.
