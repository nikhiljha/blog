<h2>Fedora Port for PinePhone (<a href="https://github.com/nikhiljha/pp-fedora-sdsetup">Git</a> or <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM/PinePhone">Wiki</a>)</h2>

[Someone](https://github.com/Torbuntu) *really* wanted to run Fedora on their PinePhone. I also use Fedora, so I began laying the groundwork to get Fedora to run on the PinePhone. Currently: calls, mobile data, and texts all work, so it's basically usable if you can look past the bugs. I'm currently working with people to get everything into upstream Fedora.

<h2>Portola App (<a href="https://gitlab.com/appteamepic/portolapp-x">Git</a>)</h2><br>

My high school doesn't have bells! Well, that's not entirely true. The bells do exist, but are never used. As a result, people end up scrambling to class much later than they probably should. This is exacerbated by the fact that every day has a different schedule, so we can never quite remember what time class starts.

Meet Portola App! (very inspired name, I know) It tells you the time you have until your next class starts, as well as when Lunch or Break ends! There are also some convenience features, such as a Virtual ID Card (to check out books from the library), a built in copy of the school newspaper, sports scores, and more! The goals are to make life on campus as easy as possible for everyone, and secondarily to create a "maker/hacker" type community at my high school.

<h2>Ethyl (<a href="https://ethyl.io/">Website</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dHvYuB6dsA">Video</a>)</h2><br>

See the <a href="https://ethyl.io/">website</a> for more information. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a massive developing category with a lot of potential applications. Unfortunately, many IoT implementations today rely on a centralized server to stay operational. Alongside the IoT movement, we have the blockchain movement, which provides distributed, secure computer systems to use. These were a few projects to test the viability of combining the two.

<h2>NEMid (<a href="https://blog.nem.io/nemid/">Post</a>)</h2>

Decentralized websites and applications shouldnâ€™t have to rely on the outworn authentication system of usernames and passwords. In order to sign in, one has to remember their passwords for each service. Even when using a password manager, passwords are still susceptible to being stolen through a website hack.

Meet NEMid, a secure way to sign in for the modern era. Using secure public key cryptography, NEMid can sign you into compatible websites and apps with only a NEM account through a standalone application.
