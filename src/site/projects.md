This list is, by no means, extensive. It doesn't even neccesarily contain the most important projects. That said, here they are.

<h2>Portola App (<a href="https://gitlab.com/appteamepic/portolapp-x">Git</a>)</h2><br>

My high school doesn't have bells! Well, that's not entirely true. The bells do exist, but are never used. As a result, people end up scrambling to class much later than they probably should. This is exacerbated by the fact that every day has a different schedule, so we can never quite remember what time class starts.

Meet Portola App! (very inspired name, I know) It tells you the time you have until your next class starts, as well as when Lunch or Break ends! There are also some convenience features, such as a Virtual ID Card (to check out books from the library), a built in copy of the school newspaper, sports scores, and more! The goals are to make life on campus as easy as possible for everyone, and secondarily to create a "maker/hacker" type community at my high school.

<h2>Ethyl (<a href="https://ethyl.io/">Website</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dHvYuB6dsA">Video</a>)</h2><br>

See the <a href="https://ethyl.io/">website</a> for more information. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a massive developing category with a lot of potential applications. Unfortunately, many IoT implementations today rely on a centralized server to stay operational. Alongside the IoT movement, we have the blockchain movement, which provides distributed, secure computer systems to use. These were a few projects to test the viability of combining the two.

<h2>NEMid (<a href="https://blog.nem.io/nemid/">Post</a>)</h2>

Decentralized websites and applications shouldnâ€™t have to rely on the outworn authentication system of usernames and passwords. In order to sign in, one has to remember their passwords for each service. Even when using a password manager, passwords are still susceptible to being stolen through a website hack.

Meet NEMid, a secure way to sign in for the modern era. Using secure public key cryptography, NEMid can sign you into compatible websites and apps with only a NEM account through a standalone application.

<h2>Things to add to this list...</h2>
- Harry Potter Wand RE
- Wizard File Transfer
- everychat.app

<h2>More..?</h2>

I have a few other projects. You might be able to find them on the blog, or at [tsukuru.club](https://tsukuru.club/). I'll try to keep this page updated as much as possible though, but smaller projects definitely won't make the cut.
